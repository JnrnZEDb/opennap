opennap is an Open Source(TM) server implementation of the popular
napster protocol.  It is written in ANSI C and was designed to run on Unix
platforms and uses a MySQL (www.mysql.org) server to handle the search
requests.  So far this server has only been tested on a Red Hat Linux 6.1 box
running mysqld 3.23.  Minimal porting should be required for compilation on
other Unix variants.

Since napster is not an open specification, much of the internals of the
servers are specific to this implementation.  In particular, I don't expect
that this server will interoperate with the official napster servers once they
are linked together.  Given that I can't run tcpdump between those servers,
I can't see how they are communicating.  I'm hoping that with the proliferation
of servers outside of napster.com, they might be willing to open up their
specification to make sure all the clients can interoperate.  However, this
server should be compliant with the several currently available Unix napster
clients.

Main differences from the official napster servers:
* servers can be linked together
* nickname registration is not supported
* normal users can create channels
* source code is freely available

What's included?
* opennap server
* metaserver for directing clients to server groups
* protocol specification
* sample client
* SOURCE CODE!
