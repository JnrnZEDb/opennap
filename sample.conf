# END of Win32 configuration.  What follows is only for the Unix versions

# if your operating system has a small limit for the maxium amount of data
# a single process is allowed to allocate, adjust this value to the maximum
# you wish to use.  on many systems this does not even require root access
# to change to a higher value (default: -1, use system default)
#max_data_size 64000000

# this value adjusts how much real memory each process is allowed to consume
# before parts of the allocated memory get swapped out (default: -1, use
# system default)
#max_rss_size 64000000

# set this to the highest value that max_connections will ever be during the
# process lifetime.  this can't be changed while opennap is running because
# on many systems it requires root privilege, and we drop those before
# handling user input as a security measure.  (default: 1024)
#connection_hard_limit 4096

# if opennap is run as root, we change to this uid after setting the hard
# limit for number of file descriptors we need (default: nobody)
#uid 99

# if opennap is run as root, we change to this gid after setting the hard
# limit for number of file descriptors needed (default: nobody)
#gid 99

# prevent opennap from being swapped to disk.  WARNING!  this should only
# be used in conjunction with the max_data_size otherwise opennap could
# consume all of your system memory (default: off)
# lock_memory 0
