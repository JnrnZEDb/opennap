* break the sql query for searching into a separate thread?  so that we don't
  hang the whole server whenever searching.  this will be important for
  servers where the number of files to search is very large.

* flood control

  need some way to prevent the user from flooding the server.  this is a
  problem since when the user first connects they will likely send a large
  amount of valid information about the contents of their mp3 library
