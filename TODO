* flood control

  need some way to prevent the user from flooding the server.  this is a
  problem since when the user first connects they will likely send a large
  amount of valid information about the contents of their mp3 library

* only local mods are notified when banned ip/users attempt to connect

* add a list users command

* server linking is still blocking for some reason, even thought the socket
  is set nonblocking before the connect() call

* automatic purging of old accounts

* add a timeout to check for blocked server connect() call

* channel ban

* rewrite server db to use two passwords for each server
