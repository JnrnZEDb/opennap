* flood control

  need some way to prevent the user from flooding the server.  this is a
  problem since when the user first connects they will likely send a large
  amount of valid information about the contents of their mp3 library

* add support for PostgreSQL

  someone pointed out that mysql is not free for commercial use.  i doubt
  that anyone would want to run a for pay napster server, but to be
  politically correct opennap should at least have support for the open
  source alternative as well

* only local mods are notified when banned ip/users attempt to connect

* add a list users command

* server linking is still blocking for some reason, even thought the socket
  is set nonblocking before the connect() call

* automatic purging of old accounts

* find the numeric for an admin to change a user's password.  format appears
  to be: <user> <password> [reason]

* add a timeout to check for blocked server connect() call
